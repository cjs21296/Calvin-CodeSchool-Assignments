Til Schweiger comes up with a slickly-made off-the-wall romantic comedy drama \"Barfuss\" (Barefoot), his first solo directing effort in nearly a decade.  Punchy, anti-establishment tone, with Schweiger playing a hedonistic bachelor - he is his rich family's black sheep - who falls for a suicidal mental patient (Johanna Wokalek).  An offbeat, strangely tender love story develops as Nick struggles with responsibility for the first time in his life.","popularity":6.465,"poster_path":"/aN4dn64CVkdYbCLroxspDHEFX9g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1989,"logo_path":"/yhrCiL7ymx6xI3o80p0hT2qKMOc.png","name":"Barefoot Films","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":106,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buena Vista International (Germany) Filmproduktion GmbH (München)","origin_country":""},{"id":107,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mr. Brown Entertainment Filmproduction GmbH (Potsdam)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barefoot","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":98}
