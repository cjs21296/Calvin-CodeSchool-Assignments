When he was finally married to his Empress, the teen-aged Bavarian princess Sisi (Elizabeth), it seems that his relief knew no bounds, for he was now sure that he would never have to think about sex ever again. According to the filmmakers, this is the true history of that marriage. This story is a complete reversal of the romantic legend depicted in the popular 1955 film Sissi, which helped brighten the emerging stardom of Romy Schneider.","popularity":1.37,"poster_path":"/rHq5Jh7Pt462gVXPduhIG7B7Ftr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2041,"logo_path":null,"name":"Calypsofilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sisi/Last Minute","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
