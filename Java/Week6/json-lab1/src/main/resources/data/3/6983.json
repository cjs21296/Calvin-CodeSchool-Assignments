All of them plunder their parents' supplies in order to build their own stage and amplifiers. Baffled by these unexplained thefts, the parents decide to hold a meeting as their suspicions turn to a group of camper folks living across from their flat. The tables are turned when the residents take a camping holiday of their own and end up being mistrusted by the locals as much as they themselves did their own neighbors. Meanwhile, the children's gang meets a rival group of kids who are planning to enter the same competition.","popularity":0.708,"poster_path":"/torzyhBq9j6FuGJ4XBlcNb7cD4K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Castor Films","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1980-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gang Next Door","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3}
