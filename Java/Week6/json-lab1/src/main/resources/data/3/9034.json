But it's been more than two decades since the Banger Sisters earned their nickname -- or even laid eyes on each other.

Together they learn to live in the moment.","popularity":7.541,"poster_path":"/jaJjG2rThvw7Z9DM9uwJ6ziCzDC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43,"logo_path":"/4RgIPr55kBakgupWkzdDxqXJEqr.png","name":"Fox Searchlight Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-09-20","revenue":38068353,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some friendships last forever... like it or not.","title":"The Banger Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":122}
