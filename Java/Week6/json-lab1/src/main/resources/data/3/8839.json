But when she enters the rickety mansion to seek her claim, she is frightened away by a wicked wave of ghosts. Determined to get her hands on this hidden fortune, she hires afterlife therapist Dr. James Harvey to exorcise the ghosts from the mansion. Harvey and his daughter Kat move in, and soon Kat meets Casper, the ghost of a young boy who's \"the friendliest ghost you know.\" But not so friendly are Casper's uncles--Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie--who are determined to drive all \"fleshies\" away.","popularity":13.74,"poster_path":"/1WeumvndgPE3hopKQqXbCKO26oH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11098,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Harvey Entertainment Company","origin_country":""},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":56,"logo_path":"/cEaxANEisCqeEoRvODv2dO1I0iI.png","name":"Amblin Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-05-26","revenue":287928194,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Get an afterlife","title":"Casper","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2551}
