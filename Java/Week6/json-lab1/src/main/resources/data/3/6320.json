He arrests one, Simon, and his girl-friend Noria. Simon's brothers go to their lawyer. He springs Noria, who promptly steals 2 million francs that belong to the Tunisians. They suspect her of the theft; her life as well as the lawyer's is in danger. Meanwhile, Noria is playing with both the lawyer and Mangin's affections. Mangin is mercurial anyway: intimidating and bloodying suspects, falling for a police commission trainee before flipping for Noria, wearing his emotions on his sleeve. Can he save the lawyer and Noria, and can he convince her to love?","popularity":5.189,"poster_path":"/nwWtQp0RcJq6eAcMNNSIFA7iF2N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1985-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Police","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":43}
