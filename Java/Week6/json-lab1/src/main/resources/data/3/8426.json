The city is called Yentown, and it is much like Tokyo. Sixteen-year-old Ageha (Ito), a young girl whose mother has just died, is passed on from person to person until a prostitute named Glico (Chara) finally takes pity on her. Under Glico's care, Ageha has many experiences with the other poverty-stricken immigrants in Yentown. Eventually, due to a sudden twist in fate, the immigrants are given a chance to realize their dreams. But in doing so, they destroy their solidarity, and have to face their problems separately.","popularity":2.724,"poster_path":"/3VmVx9X39w6FIOjiXBUXn3ojmuG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rockwell Eyes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":146,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swallowtail Butterfly","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":27}
