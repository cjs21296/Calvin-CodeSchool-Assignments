It follows their journey, from the surprise of an unopposed landing, through the bloody and exhausting battles that follow, to the ultimate departure of those who survived. A powerful frontline cast - including Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson and George Clooney - explodes into action in this hauntingly realistic view of military and moral chaos in the Pacific during World War II.","popularity":13.178,"poster_path":"/g4ApW90svay7veAPgxU8OsNMEOB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":711,"logo_path":"/tEiIH5QesdheJmDAqQwvtN60727.png","name":"Fox 2000 Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":11317,"logo_path":"/u3YB3GujS0tct5BVTsMJLWVyllg.png","name":"Phoenix Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":23660,"logo_path":null,"name":"Geisler-Roberdeau","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-12-25","revenue":98126565,"runtime":171,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every man fights his own war.","title":"The Thin Red Line","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":1473}
