(Terminal Intelligence Agency), someone has stolen Professor Bacterio's most dangerous invention, the D.O.T. (Demoralizer of Troops), an artifact that ends up in the hands of a very short, wacky dictator who is ready to use it for criminal purposes. The T.I.A Chief, though, is firm in his resolve: if he wants to get the D.O.T. back, he must NOT count on his agents Mortadelo &amp; Filemon. But when the crime fighting duo discover that the T.I.A. has engaged a cocky and slimy detective from outside the agency, they decide to act at their own risk, even if that risk involves all of Humanity.","popularity":4.749,"poster_path":"/bwhqyXlZDan9mOvRnXoH39siFp4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Películas Pendleton","origin_country":""},{"id":692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sogecine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2003-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mortadelo & Filemon: The Big Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":59}
