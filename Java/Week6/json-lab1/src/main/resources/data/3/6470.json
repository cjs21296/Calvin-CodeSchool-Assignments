Multiple attempts to assault the cartel's mountainous compound have been thwarted by a Scorpion-attack helicopter piloted by a cartel leader, Eric Stoller (Bert Rhine). After having several aircraft shot down, most notably a pair of UH–60 Black Hawks and their AH–1 Cobra escorts, the army turns to the new AH–64 Apache attack helicopter, which can match its enemies' maneuverability and firepower.","popularity":5.363,"poster_path":"/9kujKzulvgoCm5l0B80tQDm3pkM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2098,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nova International Films","origin_country":""},{"id":9195,"logo_path":"/ou5BUbtulr6tIt699q6xJiEQTR9.png","name":"Touchstone Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The best just got better","title":"Fire Birds","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":57}
