Batya, a catering waitress, takes in a young child apparently abandoned at a local beach. Batya is one of the servers at the wedding reception of Keren, a young bride who breaks her leg in trying to escape from a locked toilet stall, which ruins her chance at a romantic honeymoon in the Caribbean. One of the guests is Joy, a Philippine chore woman attending the event with her employer, and who doesn't speak any Hebrew (she communicates mainly in English), and who is guilt-ridden after having left her young son behind in the Philippines.","popularity":2.127,"poster_path":"/hTCagyFazmGez993bLX9XgG3GiP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2426,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Poisson","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2007-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life Stings","title":"Jellyfish","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":16}
