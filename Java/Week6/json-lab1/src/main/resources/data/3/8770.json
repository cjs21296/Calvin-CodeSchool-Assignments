The controversial film examines in factual, logical, and yet startling terms how easy it is to change election outcomes and undermine election integrity across the U.S. Beyond increasing the public's awareness, UNCOUNTED inspires greater citizen involvement in fixing a broken electoral system.","popularity":0.653,"poster_path":"/e4KtndVvoTgEOFfeUuOlE133rzY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncounted","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
