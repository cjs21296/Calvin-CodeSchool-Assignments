Dr. Susan McAlester genetically engineers three Mako sharks, intending to increase their brain capacity so that they can harvest the tissue as a cure for Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, the increased brain capacity also makes the sharks smarter, faster, and more dangerous. Aquatica's financial backers are skeptical and nervous about the tests, and send a corporate executive to visit the facility.","popularity":13.205,"poster_path":"/r386y8YpePXoS7P4jHWZRTF36Zb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Riche-Ludwig Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":79,"logo_path":"/tpFpsqbleCzEE2p5EgvUq6ozfCA.png","name":"Village Roadshow Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":28439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Groucho III Film Partnership","origin_country":""},{"id":174,"logo_path":"/ky0xOc5OrhzkZ1N6KyUxacfQsCk.png","name":"Warner Bros.
