The population of Kolberg refuses to capitulate and organizes the resistance against the French army, which immediately submits the city to massive bombardments. \"Kolberg\" is a unique document showing a well-oiled propaganda machine collapsing in the face of its immanent demise. It achieves the opposite of its intent. The stolid face at the end of the film with the proto-Nazi flag as a backdrop is supposed to convey a sense of determined conviction but there's fear in those eyes.","popularity":1.287,"poster_path":"/k8JrtwAri5lVqSaKXGuTw85OW1u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universum Film (UFA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1945-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kolberg","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":4}
