Rossellini takes numerous liberties with the original source material, rearranging and omitting events at will, presenting everything in a low-key, highly undramatic fashion. The film begins in Old Testament times, allowing Rossellini to present the story of Jesus in its ancient, historic context. This clip shows the Last Supper, depicted Rossellini-style.","popularity":1.7,"poster_path":"/aMaTs0SHEn5rFn2VLaQTQysO55t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2489,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orizzonte 2000","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1975-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Messiah","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":8}
