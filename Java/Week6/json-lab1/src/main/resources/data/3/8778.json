Borrowing the character of Psyche from mythology and placing her in Europe in the 19th century, the authors give her a \"modern\" life. She is an attractive young woman - and remains so throughout the film, in spite of one hardship after another. Psyche is libidinous, and her prurient interests shock her staid contemporaries.","popularity":3.146,"poster_path":"/bfjKPEcoYdud7HGW7BK6QoxpP9J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44076,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hunnia Játékfilmstúdió","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1980-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":261,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Narcissus and Psyche","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
