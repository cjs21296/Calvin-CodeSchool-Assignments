At the end of the 80s they went their separate ways with the exception of Tim and Hotte, who have remained true to their ideals and continue to fight the issues they did as a group. In 2000, with Berlin as Germany's new capital, an event happens forcing the group out of existential reason to reunite and, ultimately, come to grips with the reason they separated 12 years ago.","popularity":2.802,"poster_path":"/z6PHgCsUpcK2n7m577fSJdoIy7k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Columbia TriStar Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":161,"logo_path":null,"name":"Claussen+WÃ¶bke Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What to Do in Case of Fire?","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":21}
