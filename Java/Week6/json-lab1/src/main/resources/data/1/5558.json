Presented as chance encounters, these loosely related, intersecting situations, all without a consistent protagonist, reach from the 19th century to the 1970s. Touching briefly on subjects such as execution, pedophilia, incest, and sex, the film features an array of characters, including a sick father and incompetent police officers.","popularity":4.983,"poster_path":"/f6cON5ebistPm6AS1XcZZMmKpIi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greenwich Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1974-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Luis Bunuel's kinkiest comedy.","title":"The Phantom of Liberty","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":101}
