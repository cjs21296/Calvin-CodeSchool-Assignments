As cheerfully portrayed by Sophie Marceau, the eponymous heroine is an engagingly ribald, but perhaps rather too modern, character. She rises from an impoverished background to become a favourite of the Sun King, Louis XIV, and the mistress of the celebrated Racine, who wrote roles especially for her; but her fate, in the end, is a tragic one.","popularity":1.731,"poster_path":"/1S15uVguKe6ZxjgSnB4x5p8bLVP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1869,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMLF","origin_country":""},{"id":1871,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cofimage 5","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1997-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The rise and fall of a beauteous actress","title":"Marquise","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":9}
