The youngster is profoundly disturbed by the scenes in which the monster murders the little girl and is later killed himself by the villagers. She questions her sister about the profundities of life and death and believes her older sibling when she tells her that the monster is not dead, but exists as a spirit inhabiting a nearby barn. When a Loyalist soldier, a fugitive from Franco's victorious army, hides out in the barn, Ana crosses from reality into a fantasy world of her own.","popularity":7.836,"poster_path":"/5VRMyYh259EqPaVFJOC3fN1iBRR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12009,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elías Querejeta Producciones Cinematográficas S.L.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1973-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spirit of the Beehive","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":123}
