In Toshio Matsumoto’s controversial debut feature, seemingly nothing is taboo: neither the incorporation of visual flourishes straight from the worlds of contemporary graphic-design, painting, comic-books, and animation; nor the unflinching depiction of nudity, sex, drug-use, and public-toilets. But of all the “transgressions” here on display, perhaps one in particular stands out the most: the film’s groundbreaking and unapologetic portrayal of Japanese gay subculture.","popularity":5.808,"poster_path":"/zVOe5Gg0wBb2Yqew8uOGQF7EgJ6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9181,"logo_path":"/hObQEBMY8Es6ajSlVeBEIdqbuSK.png","name":"Art Theatre Guild","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The trials and tribulations of Eddie and other transvestites in Japan.","title":"Funeral Parade of Roses","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":46}
