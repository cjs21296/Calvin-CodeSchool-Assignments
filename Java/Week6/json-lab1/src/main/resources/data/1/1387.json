The first film from Todd Haynes (Velvet Goldmine, I'm Not There), Superstar is a hauntingly beautiful biopic that garnered immediate praise among the local film community but quickly received 2 cease-and-desist letters from Mattel, the maker of Barbie, and Karen Carpenter's family. To this day, this movie has not seen further release.","popularity":1.521,"poster_path":"/1JYPLVtOrkYNKplhrYrn0OETzM6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15830,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iced Tea Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":26}
