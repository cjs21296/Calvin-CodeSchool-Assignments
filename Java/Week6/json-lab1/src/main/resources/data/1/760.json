The two dress up as rabbis as they try to elude not only assasins from Slimane's country, but also the police, who think Pivert is a murderer. Pivert ends up posing as Rabbi Jacob, a beloved figure who's returned to France for his first visit after 30 years in the United States. Adding to the confusion are Pivert's dentist-wife, who thinks her husband is leaving her for another woman, their daughter, who's about to get married, and a Parisian neighborhood filled with people eager to celebrate the return of Rabbi Jacob.","popularity":10.249,"poster_path":"/ml5QwbOcDMOaKBOZUZpjg8QsGBh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Horse Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":459,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Pomereu","origin_country":""},{"id":16670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Nouvelle de Cinématographie (SNC)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1973-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":472}
