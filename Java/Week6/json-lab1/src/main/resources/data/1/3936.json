Things get under way when Blondie Bumstead (Penny Singleton) demands that her husband Dagwood (Arthur Lake) request a raise from his boss Mr. Dithers (Jonathan Hale), so that Blondie can afford to hire a maid.  But Dithers has no time for any salary disputes: his construction firm is currently stuck with an unsaleable old mansion, which is rumored to be haunted.  To disprove this theory, Dithers asks the Bumstead family to spend a night in the crumbling old house, throwing a retinue of servants into the bargain.  Homicidal maniacs? The Bumsteads in mortal danger?  But even a done 1000 times 'Haunted House-Homicidal Maniac' storyline somehow works here..  Because  in the end, no matter what, there's always Penny Singleton as \"Blondie\".","popularity":2.399,"poster_path":"/1fA43LFgkRJ0GtQV8y2uIk9q1gE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No one can hold a candle to them...when it comes to uproarious...wholesome fun!","title":"Blondie Has Servant Trouble","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
