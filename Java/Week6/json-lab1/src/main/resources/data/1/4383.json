The history of the case of Rosemarie, a hooker, and how she came to be strangled in her apartment is not completely clear. One of the suspects in the case was first charged, later acquitted, but never really free of an aura of culpability. British actress Belinda Lee plays the title role with her voice dubbed over in German.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A7ViOQtmIdGKJefju33zc8v9ykb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dieter-Frisko-Produktion","origin_country":""},{"id":12782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rapid Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1959-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The True Story of a Woman Who Made Love in the Play Capitals of the World!","title":"She Walks by Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
