After carrying out a flawlessly planned hit, Jef finds himself caught between a persistent police investigator and a ruthless employer, and not even his armor of fedora and trench coat can protect him. An elegantly stylized masterpiece of cool by maverick director Jean‑Pierre Melville, Le samouraï is a razor-sharp cocktail of 1940s American gangster cinema and 1960s French pop culture—with a liberal dose of Japanese lone-warrior mythology.","popularity":8.119,"poster_path":"/axuBeLVBeXfVZPGg6ph2taWRDFq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21777,"logo_path":null,"name":"TC Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":11788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie Industrielle et Commerciale Cinématographique (CICC)","origin_country":""},{"id":73,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fida Cinematografica","origin_country":""},{"id":42182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1967-10-25","revenue":39481,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"His only friend was his gun!","title":"Le Samouraï","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":383}
