Believed lost for decades, it was recently rediscovered by the BFI and has now been restored. The film moves the action from Berlin to London, where Emil goes to stay with his grandmother and cousin. Thereafter, the tale of Emil’s adventures with a gang of streetwise London children faithfully follows the original plot.","popularity":1.702,"poster_path":"/che15CCyfGnNvxNaR6knTfaM9GP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Richard Wainwright Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1935-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emil and the Detective","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
