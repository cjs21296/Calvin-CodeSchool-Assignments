French new wave icon Jean-Pierre Leaud stars as Paul, an idealistic would-be intellectual struggling to forge a relationship with the adorable pop star Madeleine. Through their tempestuous affair, Godard fashions a candid and wildly funny free-form examination of youth culture in throbbing 1960s Paris, mixing satire and tragedy as only Godard can.","popularity":7.542,"poster_path":"/qsWypOI6Y08WfDpGriKLBdxMviR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6181,"logo_path":"/wLSdapPKqkBgrRVOKcUx83hCR3Y.png","name":"Svensk Filmindustri","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":1728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sandrews","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":14679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anouchka Films","origin_country":""},{"id":6116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Argos Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1966-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jean-Luc Godard's Swinging Look at Youth and Love in Paris Today!","title":"Masculin Féminin","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":132}
