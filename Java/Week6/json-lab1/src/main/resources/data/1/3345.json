Campus radicals frame Viktor (photographed holding a joint) in an attempt to discredit both Preston and the Dean and Viktor is once again expelled. Vik injects Tae Kwan Do expert Tony with his new brain control pellets and soon Tony becomes an instrument of revenge, beating radicals to death, drowning the photographer in a developing tray, and karate-chopping a reporter in the throat to name a few.
