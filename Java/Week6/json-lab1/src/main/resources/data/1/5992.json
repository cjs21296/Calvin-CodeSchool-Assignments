Italy is the number one destination. As every year, swarms of Teutonic tourists make their way to the Adriatic Sea. Only Willi Hirsekorn (Heinz Erhardt) from Castrop-Rauxel has so far no plans to break south. That changes, however, as the bitchy neighbor Mizzi Buntje (Kate Jaenicke) proudly tells of their upcoming holiday in Italy. Willi can not afford this boasting.
