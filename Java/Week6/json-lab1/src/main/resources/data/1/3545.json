Nevertheless, gold diggers, profiteers and adventurers flock to the region. Among them is the hard-hearted land speculator Bludgeon, who tries to expel the Indians using brutal methods like slaughtering entire herds of buffalo. The Dakotas take their revenge by attacking a Union Pacific train. While Chief Farsighted Falcon and his men are out hunting, Bludgeon and his gang massacre the Indian village. The Dakota warriors retaliate and soon the gold diggers' town becomes the scene of a giant battle.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/2pPUYsNOEZok8VN2HibvCM1M75B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15326,"logo_path":"/u0ooNQKgjZqrXEf7zpRJqY1w0zx.png","name":"Georgian-Film","origin_country":"GE"},{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1968-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trail of the Falcon","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":5}
