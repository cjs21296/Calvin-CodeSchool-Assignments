Unable to accept the doctor's diagnosis that her daughter should be permanently institutionalized for psychiatric care, Rose flees with her child, heading for the abandoned town in search of answers â€“ and ignoring the protests of her husband. It's soon clear this place is unlike anywhere she's ever been. It's smothered by fog, inhabited by a variety of strange beings and periodically overcome by a living 'darkness' that literally transforms everything it touches. As Rose searches for her little girl, she begins to learn the history of the strange town and realizes that her daughter is just a pawn in a larger game.","popularity":11.989,"poster_path":"/4Zz9cF8S4E7DITosNYh3spybYJb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":559,"logo_path":"/jqWioYeGSyTLuHth0141bTGvu6H.png","name":"TriStar Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silent Hill DCP Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Davis-Films","origin_country":""},{"id":55914,"logo_path":"/fLZm5yRhOmaYb82wvCMOPiClMMB.png","name":"Konami","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-04-21","revenue":97607453,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We've been expecting you.","title":"Silent Hill","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":2213}
