Leni's family is Jewish - mother, father, older sister and daughter, brother, and grandfather. Rafi is Palestinian, in Spain since age 12. Before her father returns from work, Leni reveals Rafi's origins. He accidentally drops a block of frozen soup out the flat window, probably killing a passerby. Leni initiates a cover-up and Rafi figures out the body is probably Leni's father. The body disappears and without telling the rest of the family what they know, Leni and Rafi organize a search for dad. Mom is sure he's having an affair. Leni's belly-dancing sister kisses Rafi. Her brother grabs a rifle to shoot the Arab. Can anything be put right?","popularity":1.266,"poster_path":"/kb81DIe1oLKUyC2PYOYZ4CGyFur.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2004-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only Human","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":14}
