Katrin is attractive, just as successful and an incorrigible romantic. Chance makes the two the ideal couple. At least almost.

And so Jan sinks a little too deep in the cleavage of his secretary Melanie, and Katrin can not resist the adventurer Jonathan's lead role.","popularity":1.163,"poster_path":"/lRsSvgnmKatNQm52WMzGfstNGiN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":9}
