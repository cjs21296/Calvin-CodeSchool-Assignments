Eisenhower, head of the Allied invasion, refuses to divert troops to liberate Paris. His hand is forced by the French military leader, Philippe Leclerc, and by a Resistance uprising in the city. Von Choltitz keeps details of the uprising from the German high command in an effort to save the city being destroyed in retaliation. The film follows his turmoil as a soldier and as the man who doesn't wish to be seen by history as the cause of a beautiful city's destruction.","popularity":6.15,"poster_path":"/2zTZ8yx47XFO5dD1733LX4LUzRe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/fycMZt242LVjagMByZOLUGbCvv3.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1497,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marianne Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transcontinental Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Is Paris Burning?","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":72}
