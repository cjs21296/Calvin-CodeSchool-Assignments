It's 1945, she's married to Jérôme, a somewhat fussy milquetoast, diffident to the war around him and unwilling to move his wife to Paris, where she longs to live, shop, and party. A German outfit is bivouacked at Jérôme and Marie's crumbling château because its commanding officer is pursuing Marie. She's also eyed by a French spy working with the Allies as they plan D-Day. He woos her (posing to the Germans as her brother) and, in his passion, forgets his mission. Heroics come from an unexpected direction, and Marie makes her choice.","popularity":2.182,"poster_path":"/ai9IxQaEFc4g6OevEImarBbcPSx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions de la Guéville","origin_country":""},{"id":42420,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ancinex","origin_country":""},{"id":94707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cobela Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1966-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Matter of Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":12}
