So much happens within the film's 72 minutes that it's best to boil things down to the central storyline.\r Baby Dumpling (Larry Simms), the six-year-old son of Blondie and Dagwood Bumstead (Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake) disappears from sight during his first day at school.\r While Dagwood frantically combs the city in search of the boy, Baby Dumpling spents a nice, safe afternoon with poor little rich girl Melinda Mason (Peggy Ann Garner), who with her new playmate's help arises from her sickbed to walk across the room for the first time in months.","popularity":1.089,"poster_path":"/wsG8ntNkCnqA5tvAV1bwv6v2aAn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blondie Brings Up Baby","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
