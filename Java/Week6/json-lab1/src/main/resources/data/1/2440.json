But the 11 bullets found in the bodies, together with the 5 remaining bullets in the assassin's magazine clip, amount to 16 bullets for a gun that should normally hold 15 bullets. The investigating Swiss/Swedish team from the neutral countries overseeing the DMZ suspects that another, unknown party was involved - all of which points to some sort of cover up. The truth is much simpler and much more tragic.","popularity":8.188,"poster_path":"/iTB01AX6We1h8CAJql55dUyvSWq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7036,"logo_path":"/javbyY0ZCvlFJtly3tpZqf2NwLX.png","name":"CJ Entertainment","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":709,"logo_path":null,"name":"Intz.com","origin_country":""},{"id":710,"logo_path":null,"name":"KTB Network","origin_country":""},{"id":21415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Myung Films","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2000-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eight shots!
