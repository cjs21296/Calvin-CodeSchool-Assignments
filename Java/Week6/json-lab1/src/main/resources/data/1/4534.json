Tracy has been in stir for four years after thieving a fortune in jewels worth three million dollars. Now his loyal henchmen, Anthony and Smokey, lie in wait beside a desolate hillside road that’s apparently intended to be overlooking Malibu — but is actually some anonymous European location — as the LAPD van baring Arthur approaches. After dispensing with Arthur’s guards in a hail of machinegun fire, the three pile into a getaway car, at which point Anthony says he knows of an ideal place for them to hold up. “They’re holding a rodeo this week in Calgary”, he says. “Nobody will look for us there.” And truer words were never spoken. The only thing that I’d be looking for at a rodeo in Calgary would be a thorough ass-kicking.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uwqmMxzyQWOLPPvfbKcAOBIY8KQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produzioni Europee Associati (PEA)","origin_country":""},{"id":12135,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parnass Film","origin_country":""},{"id":118852,"logo_path":null,"name":"I.P.S.","origin_country":""},{"id":10617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bosna Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1968-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kill, Panther, Kill!","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
