He plays Lt. Bud Wilozek, one of a group of veterans recovering in the paraplegic ward of a hospital in his hometown. His former fiancée, Ellen (Teresa Wright), explains to his physician, Dr. Brock (Everett Sloane), her concern about his isolation and apparent depression since he has broken their engagment and refuses to see her. He counsels her to be patient, but when he decides to broach the issue with Bud, the embittered patient reacts angrily to the doctor's intrusiveness, and continues to refuse to see Ellen. The doctor cajoles the withdrawn paraplegic into the life of the ward, where fellow patients begin to pull Bud out of his spiritual miasma. At length, his sense of hope starts to return, and after seeing Ellen for the first time in months, he begins to contemplate the possibility of marriage.","popularity":2.948,"poster_path":"/fZhmf5R1zolUt1CV1dJj1TRkqg6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":893,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stanley Kramer Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A completely new experience between men and women!","title":"The Men","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":26}
