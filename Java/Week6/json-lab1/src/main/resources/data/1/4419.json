Much the same thing happened in 1952. While 20th Century-Fox's Les Miserables, starring Michael Rennie as beleagured ex-convict Jean Valjean, was making the rounds, a second version, lensed in Italy, was also showing up in selected theatres. Running a fast 112 minutes (hardly enough time to do full justice to the novel), U.S. release of the Italian adaptation starred Gino Servi as Valjean, whose \"new\" life as a man of position and respect is forever threatened by dogged detective Javert. Valentine Cortese costars as Cosette, Valjean's adopted daughter. English-language prints of the the Italian Les Miserables credit the direction to \"Robert Hampton\"; in fact, direction was handled by prominent European filmmaker Riccardo Freda.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/nPIHwyEgPkgSwQeALWV57q7LwwX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lux Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1948-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":188,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Mis√©rables","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
