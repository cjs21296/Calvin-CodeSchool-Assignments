Danton, well known as a spokesman of the people, had been living in relative solitude in the French countryside, but he returned to Paris to challenge Robespierre's violent rule and call for the people to demand their rights. Robespierre, however, could not accept such a challenge, even from a friend and colleague, and he blocked out a plan for the capture and execution of Danton and his allies.","popularity":4.391,"poster_path":"/qoGbvuLDi1T7Wpb6EkSLmda5Yrd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1587,"logo_path":null,"name":"P.P.
