Jacques is determinedly drinking and smoking himself to death when he meets Lucas (Dano), a homeless young man who has already given up on life. Determined to keep his legacy alive, Jacques deems Lucas is a fitting heir and takes him under his wing, schooling him in the male-centric laws of his alcoholic clubhouse: no new customers, no fraternizing with customers and, absolutely no women. Lucas is a quick study, but their friendship is put to the test when the distraught and beautiful April (Isild Le Besco) shows up at the bar seeking shelter, and Lucas insists they help her out.","popularity":3.157,"poster_path":"/qGs06cDcZdZ0VELasGAVFc5MOSa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155,"logo_path":"/cDY49SOQwJixJSMun9Haerx8dAQ.png","name":"Nimbus Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everyone needs a refuge from the world.","title":"The Good Heart","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":31}
