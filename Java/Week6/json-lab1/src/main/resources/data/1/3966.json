The upshot of all this is that Dagwood ends up in a lunatic asylum, forcing Blondie (Penny Singleton) to come to the rescue. Number 18 in the long running Blondie series.  Blondie Knows Best was writer/director Edward Bernds' first entry in the long-running \"Blondie\" series, and arguably his funniest.  Bernds was a big fan of comedian Shemp Howard (whom he'd directed in several Columbia 2-reelers) and accordingly he gives Shemp free reign in his scenes, resulting in some hystericially funny moments.  Blondie Knows Best represented Jonathan Hale's farewell to the series; in the next entry, Blondie's Big Moment, he would be replaced by Jerome Cowan as Mr. Radcliffe","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/omR9Zx3VWdFPZ1zM0M4xYd6Pzto.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dagwood Thinks He Has All The Answers...
