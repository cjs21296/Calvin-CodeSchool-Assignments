Thus it was that Columbia's 13th \"Blondie\" picture was shipped out as It's a Great Life.  The comic confusion begins when Dagwood Bumstead (Arthur Lake), intending to buy a house, buys a horse instead.  Before the film's 75 minutes have run their course, Dagwood gets mixed up in a fox hunt.  But Blondie (Penny Singleton) saves the day as usual, with the help of eccentric millionaire Timothy Brewster (Hugh Herbert).  After It's a Great Life and #14 \"Footlight Glamour\", Columbia restored the name \"Blondie\" to the titles of all subesequent installments in this long-running comedy series.","popularity":1.217,"poster_path":"/6wESNXSgvDS7EID9HDlTBhG1njY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's a Great Life","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
