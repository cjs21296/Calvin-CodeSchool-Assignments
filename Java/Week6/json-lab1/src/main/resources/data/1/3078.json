Ellie jumps ship and eventually winds up on a bus headed back to her husband. Reluctantly she must accept the help of out-of- work reporter, Peter Warne. Actually, Warne doesn't give her any choice—either she sticks with him until he gets her back to her husband, or he'll blow the whistle on Ellie to her father. Either way, Peter gets what he wants—a really juicy newspaper story.","popularity":7.565,"poster_path":"/k63JqnFvkIGWGhjsqRiksZw2OSs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-02-22","revenue":4500000,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"TOGETHER... for the first time","title":"It Happened One Night","video":false,"vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":510}
