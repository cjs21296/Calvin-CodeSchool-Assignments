Not wishing to be separated from her husband, Blondie (Penny Singleton) enrolls in college as well.  But Leighton College rules stipulate \"No Married Couples\", forcing Blondie and Dagwood to pretend that they're not married.  This causes quite a dilemma when coed Laura Wadsworth (Janet Blair) begins flirting with Dagwood and Rusty Bryant (Larry Parks) does same with Blondie.  And Blondie's discovery of a very pleasant secret threatens to expose her and Dagwood's marital status too.  The student body at this particular seat of learning is comprised of quite a few familiar faces, including Lloyd Bridges, Sid Melton, and Adele Mara.","popularity":1.985,"poster_path":"/bbQav2LMf2rkSm6rdgK4FF7iIYt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The BUMSTEADS Are Going To College...
