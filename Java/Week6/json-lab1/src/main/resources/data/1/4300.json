Industrious farmer, John Proctor, has twice made love to 17-year-old Abigail, a youth he and his wife have taken in. (His wife Elisabeth has rebuffed him for seven months; she is puritanical and cold.) When she finds John and Abigail embracing, she sends the lass from her home and John, feeling damned, agrees. Abigail vows revenge. Her chance comes when she accuses Elisabeth of witchcraft and manipulates younger girls to support her claims of seeing spirits. The town's minister and politicians want a cause: ridding the town of witchcraft is the ideal repression.","popularity":1.354,"poster_path":"/aCYBWWitF0pb5pDPUN8ZhR4FC3G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Borderie","origin_country":""},{"id":11788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie Industrielle et Commerciale Cinématographique (CICC)","origin_country":""},{"id":220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Consortium Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1957-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Witches of Salem","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":4}
