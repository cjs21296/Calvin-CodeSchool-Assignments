We will use the cninook sample database in our labs. It is designed from a learning perspective and will let us explore several relationships, RI (refrential integrity) and constraints. 


The sample database "chinook" is available in this repo and is the version as of writing of this course material. 
The link for direct download is available here - https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/

The above website also offers a visual representaion of the tables, relationships and descripitons. Please spend some time styding the database design before starting with the labs.
