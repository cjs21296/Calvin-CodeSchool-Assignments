### Point Of Sale Experience 

**Pick-A-Tune** wants to build a KIOSK that would allow its customers to purchase music using store credits. The company believes that retail stores and restaurants can 
expand their customer base and also retain existing ones. 

The KIOSK will come preloaded with  Tracks from several top-selling Albums. The customer can build a playlist by picking their favorite tracks using the screen and keyboard. The customer will be able to complete the purchase using the store loyalty card. 

You and your partner are selected to deliver the prototype. You recently learned of the SQLite database that can embed into the application. You have determined that a solution using **SQLite**, **SQL**, and **Java** would work best. 

The prototype version 1.0 will demonstrate the flow below. 

1. View all the tracks. 
2. Select tracks and add them to the playlist. 
3. View the invoice for the playlist.


### Other Notes

- Please use all the programming best practices you have learned.
- Please make **meaningful assumptions** to design your solution whereever necessary.
- I will act as the liaison between you and Pick-A-Tune. If you have questions or need clarity, please ask me.
- To make this more interesting, my answers may differ from group to group (pairing group). Each group (programming pair) must work independently of the other.
- You and your programming pair are expected to work towards the same goal and submit 1 and exactly 1 solution.
- Please treat this as a pilot of an **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product).
- Below is my favorite definition of what an MPV is :
 
>**A Minimum Viable Product (MVP), as the name implies, is the experimental version of your product, one that is just functional enough to provide value to the customer. When built right, the core of your MVP â€” the functionality where the customer finds value is the only robust part. The rest is sneakernet, vaporware, and duct tape.**
